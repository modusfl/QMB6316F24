# Practice Exercise for Assignment 1, Question 1

This page, if uploaded to a GitHub repository, 
will display images of files that are stored in this directory. 
In particular, the command 
```<img src="DIV_12_34_init_pass.png" width="500"/>```, 
which is only visible in the text of this ```README.md``` file, 
will display the image stored in the file 
```DIV_12_34_init_pass.png```. 
Following the instructions in Assignment 1, Question 1, 
add the required files to this folder, 
including the image files and this ```README.md``` file, 
making sure that all files are precisely named, 
and the images should appear below.
